# ☕ Café Cognito - Website Project
# FUTURE_PE_02

## 📋 Project Overview
This project was created as part of Task 4 for the **Prompt Engineering Track** by **Future Interns**.  
The goal was to build a simple and creative website using **no-code platforms** and integrate basic **AI-powered tools**.

Due to restrictions from the platform used (such as limitations in downloading or exporting clean code), I was unable to host the site online or share a complete structured source code.  
Instead, this repository contains:

- The **raw exported source code** (directly from the platform's "View Page Source").
- A **video demonstration** of the website, showing its design, navigation, and functionality.

## 🎥 Demonstration
A video has been recorded to demonstrate the website’s full layout, responsiveness, and interactive elements.  
You can find the video file [here](./path-to-video) inside this repository.

> ⚡ The video serves as the main showcase of the project, complementing the available code.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **No-Code Website Builder** (platform name if you want to mention)
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques**
- **AI Content Assistance** (for copywriting and image generation)

## 📌 Important Notes
- The code provided is *not fully optimized* for independent hosting due to platform constraints.
- The project emphasizes **creativity, design thinking, and user experience**, within the given limits.
- This work highlights my ability to **adapt** and **deliver complete solutions** even under technical restrictions.

## 🚀 How to Explore
1. Review the source code files included (even if partially raw).
2. Watch the demonstration video to understand the full website experience.

## ✨ Final Thoughts
Although faced with technical limitations, I stayed committed to delivering a full project, creatively solving problems and ensuring that the end result could be properly evaluated.
